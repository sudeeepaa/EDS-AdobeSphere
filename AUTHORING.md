# AdobeSphere — da.live Authoring Reference

Every block in this project is authored in [da.live](https://da.live/) using a simple table. The first row of the table is **always** the block name (with optional variant in parentheses). Subsequent rows are either **content rows** (your actual copy / images) or **config rows** in `Key | Value` form. Config rows are consumed by the block code and never rendered.

If you've never authored an EDS page before, the [aem.live tutorial](https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial) is the right starting point — this doc assumes you've already learned the basics.

---

## Page setup checklist

Every page should have, in order:

1. **Hero** (any variant)
2. **Body sections** (one or more — events grid, detail sections, forms…)
3. (optional) **Section Metadata** rows preceding a section to swap its background (`style | light`, `style | dark`, `style | flush`)

The header (`/nav`) and footer (`/footer`) are loaded from fragments — author them once and they apply everywhere.

---

## 1. Header (`/nav` fragment)

The header block always reads from `/nav`. Author the nav as a regular page with three top-level sections:

**Section 1 — Brand:**

| (just author the brand — no block needed) |
|---|
| ![logo](image-link) [**Adobe**sphere](/) |

The `<strong>Adobe</strong>` part is what gets coloured red. The image becomes the wordmark icon.

**Section 2 — Primary links:**

| (UL of links, no block) |
|---|
| - [Home](/) |
| - [Explore](/explore) |
| - [About](/about) |
| - [Contact](/contact) |

**Section 3** is optional and reserved for future utilities. Leave it empty unless you have a reason.

> The auth zone (Sign In / Sign Up vs avatar dropdown) is rendered by code based on the user's session — don't author it.

---

## 2. Footer (`/footer` fragment)

Author at `/footer`. Each top-level section becomes one footer column. The **last** section becomes the bottom strip (copyright line).

| Section 1 — brand |
|---|
| **Adobe**sphere |
| A student-built destination for discovering Adobe events, insights, and the creators shaping modern digital craft. |

| Section 2 — Quick Links |
|---|
| ### Quick Links |
| - [Home](/) |
| - [Explore](/explore) |
| - [About](/about) |
| - [Contact](/contact) |

| Section 3 — Content |

### Recognised config rows

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Source` | One of `events`, `blogs`, `creators`. Hydrates from `/data/{name}.json` (campaigns.json for events). |
| `Filter` | `field=value` (e.g. `featured=true`, `category=Workshops`). |
| `Ids` | Comma-separated list of ids — wins over `Filter`. |
| `Ids From` | Cross-reference pattern like `creators.eventIds`. Reads the current URL entity from `{source}`, takes `{field}` as an id list, and filters the cards to those ids only. |
| `Limit` | Max number of cards to render. |
| `Title` | Optional `<h2>` rendered above the grid. |
| `Empty` | Message shown when the filtered list is empty. |

---

## 5. Explore

The Explore page is authored using a combination of blocks rather than a single monolithic block. This allows complete control over the layout.

### Recommended Document Structure for Explore Page

```markdown
# Explore the AdobeSphere
Find events, stories, and creators shaping the next wave of digital creativity.

| hero (search) |
|---|
| Placeholder | Search events, blogs, creators… |

---

| tabs |
|---|
| Events & Campaigns |
| Blogs & Articles |
| Creators |

---

| cards (events) |
|---|
| Source | events |
| Pagination | 6 |
| Filters | true |

---

| cards (blogs) |
|---|
| Source | blogs |
| Pagination | 6 |
| Filters | true |

---

| cards (creators) |
|---|
| Source | creators |
| Pagination | 6 |
| Filters | true |
```

The `tabs` block automatically treats the subsequent sections as its tab panels. 
The `cards` block supports `Pagination | X` and `Filters | true` to render interactive grids without needing a dedicated "explore" block. URL params like `?tab=blogs` or `?q=text` are honored.

---

---

## 7. Detail-section

The most variant-heavy block, but each variant is mechanically simple. Use one block per logical section of a detail page.

### 7.1 Detail-section (overview)

| Detail-section (overview) |
|---|
| Title | Event Overview |
| Id Source | events |

### 7.2 Detail-section (agenda)

| Detail-section (agenda) |
|---|
| Title | Schedule & Agenda |
| Id Source | events |

### 7.3 Detail-section (people presenters / speakers / hosts)

Three variants, same pattern. Add `presenters`, `speakers`, or `hosts` to the block class:

| Detail-section (people presenters) |
|---|
| Title | Presenters |
| Id Source | events |

| Detail-section (people speakers) |
|---|
| Title | Guest Speakers |
| Id Source | events |

| Detail-section (people hosts) |
|---|
| Title | Event Hosts |
| Id Source | events |

### 7.4 Detail-section (quote) — reads `closingQuote` (events) or `featuredQuote` (creators)

| Detail-section (quote) |
|---|
| Id Source | events |

### 7.5 Detail-section (bio) — used on blog detail (author) and creator profile

| Detail-section (bio creator) |
|---|
| Title | About |
| Id Source | creators |

### 7.6 Detail-section (reach-out) — creator email + LinkedIn

| Detail-section (reach-out) |
|---|
| Title | Reach Out |
| Id Source | creators |

### 7.7 Detail-section (article-body) — blog content rendering

| Detail-section (article-body) |
|---|
| Id Source | blogs |

> Renders the `content[]` array from `blogs.json`. Each element with `type: heading` becomes an `<h2>`, `type: paragraph` becomes `<p>`, and `type: image` becomes a `<figure>`.

### 7.8 Detail-section (comments) — blog discussion thread

| Detail-section (comments) |
|---|
| Title | Discussion |

> Comments don't need an `Id Source` — the entity id comes from the URL automatically.

### Recognised config rows

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Title` | Section heading (when supported by the variant). |
| `Id Source` | One of `events`, `blogs`, `creators` — which JSON file to look up the entity. |
| `Id` | Override the URL-resolved id (rarely needed). |
| `Empty` | Message when no data is available. |

---

## 8. Profile

### 8.1 Profile (user) — editable user dashboard

| Profile (user) |
|---|

The user variant has zero config. It reads the current session.

### 8.2 Profile (creator) — creator hero header with stats

| Profile (creator) |
|---|

Reads the creator id from the URL, hydrates from `/data/creators.json`.

---

## 9. Marquee

| Marquee |
|---|
| All | tab=events |
| AI & Technology | tab=blogs&category=AI %26 Emerging Technology |
| Creative Tools | tab=blogs&category=Creative Tools %26 Product Updates |
| Industry Trends | tab=blogs&category=Industry Trends %26 Thought Leadership |
| Workshops | tab=events&category=Workshops |
| Webinars | tab=events&category=Webinars |
| Conferences | tab=events&category=Conferences |

Each row is one pill. Cell 1 is the label, cell 2 is the URL query string (without the leading `?`). Encode `&` inside category names as `%26`.

---

## 10. Stats

| Stats |
|---|
| Creators | creators | /explore?tab=creators | View All Creators → |
| Events | events | /explore?tab=events | View All Events → |
| Blogs | blogs | /explore?tab=blogs | View All Blogs → |
| Registered Users | users | /signup | Join the Community → |

Per row:
- Cell 1 — label
- Cell 2 — source: one of `creators`, `events`, `blogs`, `users` (counts unique localStorage signups), **or** a literal number like `1200`
- Cell 3 — optional CTA href
- Cell 4 — optional CTA label

---

## 11. Timeline

| Timeline |
|---|
| Ideation & Vision | Apr 09, 2026 | <ul><li>Defined MVP scope and core use-cases.</li><li>Locked pillars: Events, Blogs, Creator Profiles.</li></ul> |
| Blueprint & UX Mapping | Apr 10, 2026 | <ul><li>Mapped end-to-end UX flows.</li><li>Designed shared layout.</li></ul> |
| Data & Scaffolding | Apr 11, 2026 | <ul><li>Structured JSON data and curated platform assets.</li></ul> |

Per row:
- Cell 1 — milestone title
- Cell 2 — date string (free-form, e.g. `Apr 09, 2026`)
- Cell 3 — UL of bullet points (each `<li>` becomes one line in the card)

---

## 12. Section Metadata (cross-cutting)

To change a section's background or padding, place a Section Metadata block at the **top of the section** (before any content blocks). This is an EDS convention, not specific to AdobeSphere.

| Section Metadata |
|---|
| style | light |

Recognised values:
- `light` — light off-white background (`#f3f4f5`)
- `dark` — dark `#242024` background, white text
- `flush` — zero padding (used for hero-like full-bleed sections)
- `no-pad-top` / `no-pad-bottom` — kill one side of the section padding

You can stack multiples: `style | light, no-pad-bottom`.
